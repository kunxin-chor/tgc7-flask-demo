# Form Processing Practise

## Q1: Check age
Create a route `/ask` that will display a form to ask for the user's age.

In the `POST` version of the route, the code will determine if age is above 21. If so, 
return the string "You are able to vote" or else display "Try again in 5 years time".

## Q2: BMI
Create a route `/bmi` that will display two textfields, one for the weight (in kg) and one for the height (in metres). 

In the POST versin of the route, display the user's BMI.

## Q3: Currency Search

Use a route to display two textboxes and ask the user to enter two currency symbol.

In the POST version of the route, use the https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_RATE&from_currency=USD&to_currency=JPY&apikey=demo API to
retrieve and display the exchange rate.

You need to provide your own api key.

## Q4: Validation

In a route, display the form to ask the user for their first name, last name
and email address.

After processing the form, if the user has entered at least:

* Entered three characters for the first name
* Entered three characters for the last name
* email address contains a '@'

Then display in the template "Sign up successful".

If there any field doesn't match its rule, display in the template
"There are some issues signing up". Display in an unordered list (i.e, bullet point)
the criteria that the user didn't meet.

Advanced: Change the form to Bootstrap, and use Bootstrap error class
to display the issues. See https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#server-side for 
some hints.
